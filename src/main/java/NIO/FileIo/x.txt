I am using Eclipse to compile and run my java codes.

Here is Error I am getting.

Exception in thread "main" java.io.FileNotFoundException: file.txt (The system cannot find the file specified)
    at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Native Method)
    at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(Unknown Source)
    at java.util.Scanner.<init>(Unknown Source)
    at helloworld.main(helloworld.java:9)
Here is my Code

import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Scanner;


public class helloworld {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Scanner KB = new Scanner(new File("file.txt"));
        while (KB.hasNext()) {
            String line = KB.nextLine();
            System.out.println(line);
        }

    }
}
File.txt
I have created file.txt in same folder in my project.

Is your file directly under your project folder? – Rohit Jain Nov 27 '12 at 20:18

it is under SCR, I put one under bin as well, because scr didn't work. – Mowgli Nov 27 '12 at 20:19

Try printing new File("file.txt").exists() Is it yielding true? if not, try printing new File("file.txt").getAbsoluteFile() Is it what you expected? – amit Nov 27 '12 at 20:20

It is looking for the file file.txt in the same directory you are executing this from. If that is from a IDE, check what the working directory is set to. – jco.owens Nov 27 '12 at 20:20

Try putting it under the same folder as your .class files. – sbyd Nov 27 '12 at 20:21

Your file should directly be under the project folder, and not inside any other sub-folder.

So, if your project folder is MyProject, it's folder structure(not complete though) should be like: -

MyProject +- src +
          |      |
          |      +-- Your source file
          +- file.txt
It should not be under src folder.

Or, you can give the following path relative to the project folder to search for file in the src folder: -

new File("src/file.txt");
