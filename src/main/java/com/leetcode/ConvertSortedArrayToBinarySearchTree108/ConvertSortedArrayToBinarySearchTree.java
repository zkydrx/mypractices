 * Description:
 * Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
 * <p>
 * For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees
 * of every node never differ by more than 1.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
 * <p>
 * One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:
 * <p>
 * 0
 * / \
 * -3   9
 * /   /
 * -10  5
