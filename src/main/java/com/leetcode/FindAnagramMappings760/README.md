#Explain
1. To be honest I think the subject isn't rigorous becaues
   if the array have two or more element are same with each other
   and the mapping are not only one.
   for example:
   
        A =[1,2,23,4,5,6,3,4,5,6];
        B =[3,4,4,5,6,5,6,23,1,2];
2. It looks like that only use two for() loop to traversal every element. And 
   I don't have idea about other way.
3. Today does not walk, will have to run tomorrow.
