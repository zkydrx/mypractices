# Explain:

1. TreeNode was a data structure and it's official definition is that:

   public class TreeNode
   {
   int val;
   TreeNode left;
   TreeNode right;

        TreeNode(int x)
        {
            val = x;
        }
   }

2. If I am in trouble and I will try my best to solve it and I write the process and result for next time in the
   feature.
