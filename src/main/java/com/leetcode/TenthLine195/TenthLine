How would you print just the 10th line of a file?

For example, assume that file.txt has the following content:

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
Line 10
[show hint]



Shell script:
        
        sed '10q;d' a.md
        
        
        
        
        sed -n '2p' < file.txt
        will print 2nd line
        
        sed -n '2011p' < file.txt
        2011th line
        
        sed -n '10,33p' < file.txt
        line 10 up to line 33
        
        sed -n '1p;3p' < file.txt
        1st and 3th line
        
        and so on...
